# VR Engineering: Haptic_Glove
Designed and implemented a working prototype of Haptic Gloves, as a team project, under the course Virtual Reality Engineering (VR) @ IIT Madras 

PROBLEM DEFINITION: “ Creating a wearable glove embedded with mechanical systems, which can make the hand feel a sense of touch, thermal state - hot/cold - and a kinesthetic finger feedback when it touches an obstacle in the virtual world ” 

There are two scripts, one in arduino and other in c#. "Sending.cs" is a c# script to connect to arduino using serial port. "receiving_unity.ino" is an arduino file to recieve from unity.
